This is an unfinished app that I started with/for another guy.  The idea behind the app is to help users create idea profiles that can be shared with potential partners, investors, etc. 

Most of the work so far was done on the front end using React.js.  The little bit done on the back end uses an Express.js app.  So far the back end has the following:
* Authenticating users.

* Basic organization and structure for a RESTful api.

* Protected all api routes.

* Uses an OrientDB document graph database for data persistence.
